## Running the Code
To run the code, the user must create a main(){} that instantiates the database object. Since the program is written in C++, the user must have C++ installed. I recommend that the user uses CLion or VSCode but any IDE that supports C++ is okay.

## Modifications
This assignment should either have the student write a main(){} that tests all of the required function or provide a main(){} that they can use. I think that providing a main(){} for the student would be more beneficial because it can serve as a tool for grading as well as ensuring that the student is on the right track for their program. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if there were more examples of each function.
